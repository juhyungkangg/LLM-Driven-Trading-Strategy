# Problem Statement

**“Can ChatGPT beat S&P 500?”**

This study seeks to examine whether Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o mini, can be employed in conjunction with alternative data sources such as financial news and Reddit submissions to outperform the S&P 500 index. Our objectives are to extract sentiment and reliability scores from each text, as well as relevance scores related to individual stocks from these textual data sources, and to develop a trading strategy that leverages these insights to inform investment decisions.
