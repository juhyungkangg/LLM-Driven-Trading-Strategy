The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) for sentiment analysis in trading strategies represents a cutting-edge advancement beyond traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches. Our methodology uniquely amalgamates high-volume alternative data sources with sophisticated language models to generate actionable trading signals. This innovative strategy facilitates the precise capture of both overarching market sentiment and individual stock sentiments, thereby potentially providing a significant competitive advantage over conventional quantitative strategies that rely exclusively on historical price data or rudimentary sentiment analysis techniques.
