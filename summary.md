# Summary

We generated signals from 4.2 million news articles and 2.2 million Reddit submissions using a graphical user interface (GUI) that we developed to streamline the management of prompts, models, chains, and the execution of models. By analyzing the sentiment and reliability scores of each text, as well as the relevance scores for each pertinent ticker generated by ChatGPT-4o mini, we constructed both overall market sentiment and individual ticker sentiment for each date. Utilizing these insights, we developed an investment strategy that targets stocks with high sentiment scores during periods of short-term momentum in market sentiment. Our backtesting results from 2009 to 2019 demonstrate that this strategy achieved a maximum Sharpe ratio of 2.6, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index over the same period.
