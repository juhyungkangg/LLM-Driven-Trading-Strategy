# Conclusion

**“Yes, ChatGPT can beat S&P 500.”**

This study demonstrates that integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with alternative data sources, such as Reddit submissions and financial news, can effectively generate trading signals that outperform traditional benchmarks like the S&P 500 index. By leveraging the advanced text interpretation capabilities of OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o mini, we extracted nuanced and detailed sentiment information from extensive unstructured datasets. Utilizing this enriched sentiment data, we developed a momentum-based trading model that achieved a Sharpe ratio of 2.6 during the in-sample period (2009–2019) and maintained strong performance with a Sharpe ratio of 2.4 in the out-of-sample period (2020–January 2024), significantly surpassing the performance of the S&P 500 in both periods. These findings highlight the substantial potential of LLMs in quantitative finance, demonstrating their ability to adapt to varying market conditions and maintain effectiveness over time. This paves the way for the development of more sophisticated models capable of interpreting complex textual data to inform and enhance investment decisions.
